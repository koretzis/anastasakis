      <description>&lt;p&gt;My career is a synthesis of two distinct but deeply connected fields: professional software engineering and academic computational neuroscience. My work is driven by a foundational curiosity to understand how the brain&amp;rsquo;s biological hardware gives rise to the software of the mindâ€”specifically, how we learn and remember.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My academic journey began with a Diplom in Physics from the University of Crete, which provided a strong quantitative lens through which to view the world. This led me to an MSc in Brain &amp;amp; Mind Sciences, where I delved into the brain&amp;rsquo;s computational architecture. This period was defined by hands-on research at the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), during my lab rotations and earlier my bachelor thesis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
