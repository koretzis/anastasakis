        <p>My career is a synthesis of two distinct but deeply connected fields: professional software engineering and academic computational neuroscience. My work is driven by a foundational curiosity to understand how the brain&rsquo;s biological hardware gives rise to the software of the mind—specifically, how we learn and remember.</p>
<p>My academic journey began with a Diplom in Physics from the University of Crete, which provided a strong quantitative lens through which to view the world. This led me to an MSc in Brain &amp; Mind Sciences, where I delved into the brain&rsquo;s computational architecture. This period was defined by hands-on research at the Foundation for Research and Technology-Hellas (FORTH), during my lab rotations and earlier my bachelor thesis.</p>
<p>To bridge theory with real-world application, I then pivoted into technology, working as a professional <strong>Frontend Developer</strong> at Acmon Data and Desquared. In these roles, I designed and developed scalable web applications, developed my skills in modern frameworks like Angular, and operated within agile, CI/CD environments. I also applied machine learning to practical business problems as a Data Scientist at home24 in Berlin, developing algorithms for fraud detection.</p>
<p>Today, through a second MSc in <strong>Data Analysis and Machine Statistical Learning (DAMSL)</strong>, I aim to unify my experience to tackle complex, data-driven questions in medicine.</p>
